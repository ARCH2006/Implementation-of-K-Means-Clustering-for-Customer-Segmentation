# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
```
step 1:Start
step 2:Import dataset and print head,info of the dataset
step 3:check for null values
step 4:Import kmeans and fit it to the dataset
step 5:Plot the graph using elbow method
step 6:Print the predicted array
step 7:Plot the customer segments
step 8:stop
```
## Program:
```
/*
